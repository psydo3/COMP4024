### **Description**:
- **Overview**: Number Ninja is an educational game designed to enhance the mathematical skills of children aged 11-14, corresponding to Key Stage 3 in the UK national curriculum. The game aims to provide a fun and interactive way for students to practice and improve their understanding of various mathematical concepts through a quiz format that challenges them to answer questions correctly before time runs out.
- **Game Idea**: The core idea of Number Ninja is a math quiz game where players must select the correct answer to math questions from multiple choices presented as bubbles on the screen. These bubbles will gradually drop towards the bottom of the screen, and the player must choose the correct answer before they disappear. The game is set within the context of the UK Year 7 to 9 academic syllabus, focusing initially on basic operations, decimals, and fractions.

- We have two primary branches - main and develop. We use a new feature branch for every feature that we work on.  
  All of our development effort happens in feature branches which are created from the develop branch. Once the feature development is complete, the feature branch is promptly merged into the develop branch and then deleted once safe.  
  After further testing, once its ready for deployment, we merge the develop branch into the main branch.
